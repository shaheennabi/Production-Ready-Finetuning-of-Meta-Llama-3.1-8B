## Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA)

Before diving into the **QLORA** technique, let's first understand the concepts involved.

### What is QLORA?

**QLORA** stands for **Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation**. The name itself tells us about the two main components:
1. **Quantization**: The model is first quantized (reduced in precision) from high-precision 32-bit floating point values to a lower precision, such as 4-bit integers. This step reduces the model size significantly, making it more memory-efficient.
2. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: After quantization, we fine-tune the model by adding **low-rank** adaptation layers. These are smaller, trainable matrices that allow the model to adjust to specific tasks without retraining the entire model.

So, in QLORA, we first **quantize the model**, and then apply **LoRA** for fine-tuning.

### What Does Floating Point Mean?

Floating-point numbers can represent a wide range of values, including integers, decimals, and fractions. They are especially useful for representing very large or very small numbers. 

In the case of **32-bit floating-point representation**, the number is broken down into three main components:
- **Sign bit**: 1 bit to indicate whether the number is positive or negative.
- **Exponent**: 8 bits to represent the magnitude of the number (how large or small it is).
- **Mantissa (or significand)**: 23 bits to represent the precision of the number.

#### Example of 32-bit Floating Point Representation:

Consider the number **-3.75**:

| Component | Bits Used | Value | Binary Representation |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Sign bit | 1 bit | Negative (1) | 1 |
| Exponent | 8 bits | 1 (after bias) | 10000000 |
| Mantissa | 23 bits | 1.111 binary | 11100000000000000000000 |
| **Complete 32-bit** | **32 bits** | **-3.75** | **1 10000000 11100000000000000000000** |

### How Does Quantization Work (32-bit to 4-bit)?

When we **quantize** the model, we convert the floating-point weights from a higher precision (e.g., 32-bit) to a lower precision (e.g., 4-bit). 

#### Example of 32-bit to 4-bit Quantization:

| Original Value (32-bit) | Memory Used | Quantized Value (4-bit) | Memory Used | Possible Values |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| -3.75 (float32) | 32 bits | 8 (int4) | 4 bits | 16 levels (0-15) |
| 2.5 (float32) | 32 bits | 12 (int4) | 4 bits | 16 levels (0-15) |
| -1.2 (float32) | 32 bits | 4 (int4) | 4 bits | 16 levels (0-15) |

### Quantization Process Example:

Consider a range of weights from -5.0 to 5.0 being quantized to 4-bit (0-15):

| Original Weight | Scaled & Mapped (0-15) | 4-bit Quantized Value |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| -5.0 | 0 | 0000 |
| -3.75 | 3 | 0011 |
| -2.5 | 6 | 0110 |
| 0.0 | 8 | 1000 |
| 2.5 | 11 | 1011 |
| 3.75 | 13 | 1101 |
| 5.0 | 15 | 1111 |

### Memory Savings Example:

| Model Size | 32-bit Size | 4-bit Size | Memory Savings |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1M params | 4 MB | 0.5 MB | 87.5% |
| 7B params | 28 GB | 3.5 GB | 87.5% |
| 13B params | 52 GB | 6.5 GB | 87.5% |

### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):

Once the model has been quantized to 4-bit precision, we apply **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** for fine-tuning.

- **LoRA** involves adding small, trainable low-rank matrices to the model. These matrices are not part of the original model but allow fine-tuning without retraining the full model.
- This reduces the computational cost and memory footprint, as only the small low-rank matrices are trained.

In practice, **QLORA** applies LoRA on top of the quantized model to enable efficient fine-tuning on tasks with limited computational resources.

### Summary of QLORA:

- **QLORA = Quantization + LoRA**:  
  1. **Quantization**: The model's weights are converted from 32-bit floating-point precision to lower precision (like 4-bit integers) to reduce memory usage.
  2. **LoRA**: Small, trainable matrices are added for fine-tuning the model on specific tasks without retraining the entire model.
  
- **Quantization Process**:
  1. Convert from high precision (32-bit) to low precision (e.g., 4-bit) by scaling and clipping.
  2. The weights are stored as integers, reducing memory usage.
  
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**:  
  Only small low-rank matrices are trained, saving time and resources.

This combination of **quantization** and **LoRA** makes QLORA a powerful technique for fine-tuning large models like LLaMA 8B on machines with limited memory and computational power.
